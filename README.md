1. INTRODUCTION

I was excited to participate in the #DataCleaningChallenge organized by Promise Chinonso. Data cleaning is the heart and soul of Exploratory data analysis (EDA). It is estimated that data cleaning process alone takes up 60% of the data analysis process. Data Cleaning ensures that relevant, correct, consistent and complete dataset is employed in analysis. I made use of SSMS (SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO) and a lit bit of excel (prior to uploading the data in SSMS) to clean the dataset.

2. What to consider when cleaning your data
